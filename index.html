                      <li>HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers.</li>
                      <li>Then comes the HTML 2.0, published in 1995, which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional features.</li>
                      <li>Then comes the HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett who introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. </li>
                      <li>It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages.</li>
                      <li>Then comes HTML 4.01, which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide.</li>
                      <li>HTML 5 can be said for an extended version of HTML 4.01, which was published in the year 2012.</li>
                      <p>"I'm OK with procedural code, and the web is a top-down type of problem. It makes sense to me that you have HTML, you spit out a bunch of HTML, then you call a function to do something and then call another function."</p>
